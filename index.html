     <h2>Jariel-Jon Miller</h2>
     <p>I am currently a university student, pursuing a 
        Computer Science major and a Chinese minor. I am 
        also in my second year. I enjoy reading, watching 
        movies, walking and farming. I like to eat cheese. 
        I am interested in Web Development because I am  
        interested in being a cyber security analysis and 
        having knowledge of Web Development will be 
        beneficial to me.</p>
